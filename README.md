# Graph-Traversals-in-a-Cube

### Graph traversals using Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Astar algorithms is performed to find shortest distance from one point in 3D space to another point. 
### Different algorithms perform better in different situations. Astar being the best in most cases.
